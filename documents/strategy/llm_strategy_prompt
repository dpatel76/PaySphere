## REASONING APPROACH

Apply first principles thinking and chain-of-thought reasoning:

1. **Decompose** each problem into fundamental components
2. **Research** thoroughly before recommending
3. **Analyze** multiple options with evidence
4. **Synthesize** findings into coherent recommendations
5. **Validate** logic and completeness before finalizing
6. **Document** reasoning transparently

For each major recommendation, explicitly state:
- The problem being solved
- Options considered
- Evaluation criteria applied
- Evidence supporting the recommendation
- Risks and mitigations
- Implementation implications
