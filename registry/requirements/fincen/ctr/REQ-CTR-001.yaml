      Must implement both single-transaction threshold check AND
      aggregation logic for multiple transactions. The threshold
      is >= $10,000 (transactions of exactly $10,000 ARE reportable).

    test_scenarios:
      - "Single transaction of $10,000 - REPORTABLE"
      - "Single transaction of $9,999 - NOT REPORTABLE"
      - "Single transaction of $10,001 - REPORTABLE"
      - "Multiple transactions totaling $10,000 same day - REPORTABLE"
      - "Multiple transactions totaling $9,999 same day - NOT REPORTABLE"
